        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
          Allow anyone to shop, transfer money, and more without a debit or
          credit card or the need to visit a physical bank or store
        </p>
        <h2>Reason</h2>
        <p>
          The world of buying and selling has changed—more and more transactions
          happen online without the need for a physical credit or debit card.
          The amount of online sales and transactions is and has been steadily
          increasing, consumers are subscribing to a multitude of online
          services, and high street stores are closing in large numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many factors that make online purchases favorable, from cost
          and convenience, to security, to name but a few. This ecommerce trend
          has been catalyzed by the global coronavirus pandemic in 2020, forcing
          many people to stay inside, wary of going to the store and of using
          their physical cards to pay for items.
        </p>
        <p>
          With it, this trend has brought forward the problem of how to make
          purchases securely and efficiently. How can your banking and card
          details be stored in one place? How can this same tool be used to make
          transactions or transfers in online stores and overseas? What’s
          important to users when buying online?
        </p>

        <p>
          To gain a better understanding of our problem I have started with
          competitive analysis to understand the market place, what solutions
          (and how were the implemented) already exist, identify competitors
          strengths and pinpoint gaps.
        </p>
        <p>
          I choose PayPal & G Pay for this research because of their strong
          market position and for the fact that both of them offer similar
          functionality to what is expected of this development project.
        </p>
        <img src="../assets/img/plutopay/sec_01_01.svg" alt="swat" />
        <p>
          With gaps in the market and opportunities identified I have turned to
          my primary research to collect additional data from potential users to
          help drive the design decisions. For quantitative data I have
          conducted surveys and for qualitative data I selected interviews.

            <h4>Goals</h4>
            <p>
              To better understand user behaviour around the finances, online
              shopping, budgeting, saving money and money transfers.
            </p>
            <p>
              To determine which tasks users would like to complete using
              PlutoPay web responsive app
            </p>
            <p>
              Documenting user pain points with existing finance and budgeting
              apps available on the market.
            </p>
            <p>
              Collecting data on the context in which users would use banking
              and budgeting services.

          After user research next step for me was to structure and analyse all
          date to unveil any finding and insights. The affinity map was the
          perfect tool for this as it helps to identify the natural
          relationships between large number of ideas.

        <h3>Problem statement</h3>
        <p>
          Our users need a way to manage their personal finances and
          transactions in one place that is easily accessible because in the
          modern day environment it will allow users to better balance their
          multiple finance tools. We will know this to be true when we see
          increased amount of users utilising our platform to efficiently manage
          their financial needs.
        </p>
        <h3>User Personas</h3>
        <p>
          From foundation based on my research and analysis I was able to
          construct two user personas. Those formed a base for creating
          emotional connection between our goal defined in problem statement and
          actual target demographic that I am designing for. It helps to have a
          "face" not just the facts during this process.

        <h3>USer Flows</h3>
        <p>
          I have set up user flows to bring focus to what and how users need to
          accomplish their goal in most straightforward way. Looking at their
          goal from this perspective helps creating better user experience as it
          put the user at te heart of the process.

          The card sorting revealed that the grouping of the subcategories were
          slightly different than originally expected. Minor changes were
          applied to the sitemap in order to put sub items in the categories the
          testers felt appropriate for

        <h3>Low Fidelity</h3>
        <p>
          Further design iterations and testing allowed me to come up with more
          detailed mid fidelity wireframes to present basic placement and
          functionality of the user interface.

        <h3>Low Fidelity</h3>
        <p>
          After refinements to user interface I was able to produce high
          fidelity wireframes to better visualise information architecture,
          actual content and intended design language.
        </p>
        <p>
          After limited testing including my group of peers and some guerrilla
          testing, following improvements to the design were implemented to
          improve the user experiance & expectations:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            users need a way to apply only required filters in transactions
            history
          </li>

          <li>
            users required their saving goal to provide more information in the
            overview
          </li>
          <li>
            over all typography review concentrated on readability and hierarchy
          </li>
        </ul>
        <img

          alt="High FIdelity Mockups"
        />
        <h3>Prototype</h3>
        <p>
          Digital high fidelity wireframes enabled me to create clickable
          prototype that was essential to communicate with stakeholders as well
          as to conduct further testing that would drive further development,
          refinement and iterations of the application.

        <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
        <p>
          Before commencing actual testing of my design I have created usability
          test plan that outlines scope, goal and logistics of the testing
          sessions. It will also serve as documentation for stakeholders
          included in the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          To avoid errors, keep my testing sessions consisted across
          participants and to maintain compliance with ethical & moral standards
          I also created usability test script. This also ensured consistent
          information gathering approach with the goals I previously outlined.
        </p>
        <div>
          <p>6 Participants</p>
          <p>REMOTELY MODERATED SESSIONS</p>
          <p>40-45 MIN PER SESSION</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Reserch Report & Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          All sessions were recorded with participants consent for detailed
          review. Analysis included interpreting language, tone of voice, mouse
          movements and confidence performing tasks in scenario and information
          gathering to get emotional picture of user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have translated all the finding into rainbow sheet and structured
          feedback by participant. This have allowed me to get frequency and
          severity of the issues at hand.
