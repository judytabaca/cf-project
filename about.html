            <h1>Hello! I'm Judyta Baca</h1>
            <p>
              But my friends & family call me Judy. I'm a UX/UI designer with a
              keen eye and interest in front-end development, hoping to further
              my career in the design space. My main interest is creating better
              experiences for people and reaching for excellence. I was born in
              Poland but the winds of life took me through many places from the
              dunes of Dubai to the highlands of Scotland where I spent most of
              my life relaxing by a loch (lake - in plain Scottish).
            </p>
            <p>
              I started my journey in tourism & hospitality management because
              of my strong desire to help others and whereas Iâ€™d like to think I
              was designing and delivering experiences. During this time, I
              developed a strong sense of empathy for others through learning
              their pain points and seeing the world from their perspective.
              Working in such a social environment has taught me that everyone
              has a story to tell and the importance of being open to ideas. I
              believe that every problem has a good solution if we remember to
              be open, flexible, and adjustable to change.
            </p>
            <p>
              Why the transition to user experience? I have always enjoyed
              engaging both the creative and analytical parts of my brain. For a
              long time, I didn't know how to combine the two into a career.
              Finding UX Design and specializing in UI was the perfect mix of
              the two for me and it has only enhanced my desire to help people.
              I intend to leverage my prior experience to bring a level of
              empathy and attention to detail that's critical to making
              intuitive user experiences.
            </p>

            <p>
              In my spare time, youâ€™ll find me creating content for my personal
              videography projects, brushing up on my photography skills or
              running a 5K or at least trying to get to the finish line.
