          <h1>Hello! I'm Judyta Baca</h1>
          <p>
            But my friends & family call me Judy. I'm a UX/UI designer with a
            keen eye and interest in front-end development, hoping to further my
            career in the design space. My main interest is creating better
            experiences for people and reaching for excellence. I was born in
            Poland but the winds of life took me through many places from the
            dunes of Dubai to the highlands of Scotland where I spent most of my
            life relaxing by a loch (lake - in plain Scottish).
          </p>
          <p>
            I started my journey in tourism & hospitality management because of
            my strong desire to help others and whereas Iâ€™d like to think I was
            designing and delivering experiences. During this time, I developed
            a strong sense of empathy for others through learning their pain
            points and seeing the world from their perspective. Working in such
            a social environment has taught me that everyone has a story to tell
            and the importance of being open to ideas. I believe that every
            problem has a good solution if we remember to be open, flexible, and
            adjustable to change.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why the transition to user experience? I have always enjoyed
            engaging both the creative and analytical parts of my brain. For a
            long time, I didn't know how to combine the two into a career.
            Finding UX Design and specializing in UI was the perfect mix of the
            two for me and it has only enhanced my desire to help people. I
            intend to leverage my prior experience to bring a level of empathy
            and attention to detail that's critical to making intuitive user
            experiences.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my spare time, youâ€™ll find me creating content for my personal
            videography projects, brushing up on my photography skills or
            running a 5K or at least trying to get to the finish line.
